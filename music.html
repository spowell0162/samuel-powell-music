                <h3>Part Four Records</h3>
                <p>Both of these tracks came together very quickly. Aries began with an experiment with generative beats
                    and white noise, however, the evolving melody was the focus in the end. Elsione was built around a
                    simple chord progression with granular vocal bursts. A more straightforward dance track than Aries,
                    the gated baseline and one-chord arp slowly open up over the duration of the piece. </p>

                <h2>Owls</h2>
                <h3>Shall Not Fade</h3>
                <p>A motley crew of tracks, this collection was written over the course of about 18 months. This meant
                    the result reflected many different states of mind I was in over that period. From the euphoria of
                    Fold, the heaviness and frustration of Echrete, to the peacefulness of Owls. There was a wide
                    variety of techniques used across the board. There are no samples in Detuned apart from the kick
                    drum; everything else is completely synthesized. Much of the atmosphere in Echrete comes from
                    pushing modular FM synthesis to extreme limits. The field recordings in Owls were taken from a walk
                    along the canal near my house.</p>

                    <h2>Floating/Sulphur</h2>
                    <h3>Self-released</h3>
                    <p>Floating existed for about a year under a different alias before it was re-released. Josh Meany
                        was experimenting with a video-editing technique which he felt matched the energy of the song,
                        so I decided to make some improvements to the tune and re-release it with the energetic and
                        bittersweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0A1RGIe40Q" target="_blank">video</a> made
                        by Josh. At the same time, Shay O'Donoghue approached me
                        about making a
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiIOlcktrXQ&t=97s">video</a>, which became Sulphur. For
                        this, Shay took a time-lapse video of a drive around our
                        hometown Naas, Kildare.
